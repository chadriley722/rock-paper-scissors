# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, created as part of my coding journey.

## About

This project is a practice exercise to help me learn JavaScript fundamentals. It's part of my self-study curriculum using:

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## Project Goals

- Practice JavaScript fundamentals
- Implement game logic
- Work with random number generation
- Handle user input
- Create a simple interactive game

## How to Play

1. The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors
2. The player makes their choice
3. The winner is determined based on the classic rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock

## Learning Progress

This project is helping me learn:
- JavaScript functions
- Control flow
- Random number generation
- Basic game logic
- User interaction
